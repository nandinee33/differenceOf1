Given an array A of size N. Print all the numbers less than K in the array. The numbers should be such that the difference between every adjacent digit should be 1.

# Note: Print '-1' if no number if valid.

# Input Format: 
The first line consists of an integer T i.e number of test cases. T testcases follow. Each testcase contains two lines of input. The first line consists of two integers N and K separated by a space. The next line consists of N spaced integers.

Constraints: 1 <= T <= 100 1 <= N <= 10 5 1 <= K , A[i] <= 1018

# Output Format:
For each testcase, print the required output.

# Sample Input 0:
# 1
# 8 54
# 7 98 56 43 45 23 12 8
